  "bioText": "System Of The Down – The Tribute Band was founded in the summer of 2018 by four SOAD enthusiasts in order to play the music we enjoy and through which we would like to show our respect for this amazing music group. You could say that our band was born basically in a span of two phone calls. The main problem was finding the rehearsal room, which we finally managed to find after several months in October 2018 and the band could pick up the pace, thanks to which it was possible to play the first concert in half a year and fill up the Bamboo club in Zlín. Each member of the band loves creating and does their best in order to achieve the best possible result. We would like all the System of a Down fans to experience a trip through a portfolio of this amazing band which, unfortunately, does not visit our country very often, but whose songs are known to people all over the world",
